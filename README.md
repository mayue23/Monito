# Monitos Pets - Group Challenge

## Welcome to this group challenge! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out the Monitos Pet Store and get it looking as **close** to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go. Remember, you can always go and check previous design challenges in the course and use the CSS learned for this and future challenges.

### Mandatory

-   From now on, your projects should follow BEM: [BEM class naming convention](https://getbem.com/naming/) or checkout this [this article](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)

-   Use CSS variables: [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
-   You must orginize your CSS (using external stylesheets)

-   You should make use of Flexbox and all its properties

-   You must start, whenever possible, using [REM units](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp) units for specifying, widths, heights, fonts, etc. This improves the accessibility of your website. Check more about [Accessible responsive design](https://web.dev/accessible-responsive-design/)

-   Your document has to be semantic, check [semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) (divs are ok just for styling purposes)

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

1. Look through the design to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. **Writing your HTML first** can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content and SEMANTIC HTML.
3. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
4. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
5. Remember to start using external stylesheets with the `link` element. Create a folder called CSS in the root of your project.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
